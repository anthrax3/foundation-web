THE OPENBSD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR C2K8 CONFERENCE

The OpenBSD Foundation is pleased to announce that it has completed
arrangements with the University of Alberta in Edmonton to host the
2008 Annual OpenBSD Developer's Conference (C2K8 Hackathon)
from June 7 to June 15, 2008.

The facility support from the University of Alberta Computer Science
Department will provide C2K8 the best facilities yet for the annual
OpenBSD Developer Conference. C2K8 will be the 10th annual event of
its kind. Previous hackathons have produced tools such as the PF
firewall, OpenBGP, relayd and spamd, as well as innumerable
critical improvements to OpenBSD, OpenSSH, and related projects.

This year, the OpenBSD Foundation will disburse approximately $15,000
to support C2K8, enabling more than 50 OpenBSD developers from around
the world to attend this important event. The Foundation thanks
all who have generously donated the resources to make C2K8
possible.

The OpenBSD Foundation relies on donations of money and equipment from
corporations and individuals to make events like this one possible. If
you or your organization are interested in making a contribution,
please contact us at: directors@openbsdfoundation.org.
