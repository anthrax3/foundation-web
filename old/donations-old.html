<hr>
The OpenBSD foundation exists as a place where donations can be made
to further OpenBSD, OpenSSH, and related software projects. We are
a Canadian federally incorporated not-for-profit corporation, which means
funds directed to us must be directed towards our stated objects, other
than what we require for operating overhead. We endeavor to keep our
overhead as small as possible.
<p>We are not a registered charity, in the sense that we do not issue
tax deductible receipts. The reporting overhead (accounting and legal
costs) to operate a registered charity in Canada is prohibitive
without a sizable revenue stream. Currently, this would divert a great
deal of resources that could be better utilized in helping build good
free software. We do issue reciepts for all donations which while
not deductable as charitable donations in Canada may be used for
accounting and/or tax purposes.
<p>The Foundation will work in cooperation with the OpenBSD development
team to ensure funds are applied to areas of greatest need.
<br>
<p> Donations may be made by cheque in CAD/EUR/USD funds to:
<ul><li>The OpenBSD Foundation<br>
8101 160 Street<br>
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada<br>
T5R 2G9
</ul>
Receipts will be issued for donations of $500 or more for cheques.
