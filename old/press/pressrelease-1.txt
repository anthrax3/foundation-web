THE OPENBSD FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES FIRST CORPORATE DONATIONS

The OpenBSD Foundation is privileged to announce the receipt of
its first corporate cash donations.

The very first donation was received from Norwegian network engineers
SystemNet AS.

This was followed very shortly by several significant anonymous
donations, as well as contributions from Hewlett Packard and Google.

Many thanks to our corporate donors.

All donations were received soon after the Foundation announced its
existance, enabling the Foundation to start operations and perfect
its donation handling.  These donations have enabled the Foundation
to assume the costs of OpenBSD's networking expenses, and begin to
acquire several key pieces of hardware for development and infrastucture. 

The OpenBSD Foundation is a Canadian federally incorporated not-for-profit
corporation dedicated to the support of OpenBSD and related projects.
For more details please visit our website at www.openbsdfoundation.org.

Corporations and other organizations wishing to support OpenBSD with
donations of money or equipment can contact the directors of the
Foundation at directors@openbsdfoundation.org.
