The OpenBSD Foundation is pleased to announce today it has completed
its organization as a Canadian federal non-profit corporation and is
ready for public interaction.
    
The OpenBSD Foundation has been formed for the purpose of supporting
the OpenBSD project, and related projects such as OpenSSH, OpenBGPD,
OpenNTPD, and OpenCVS.

In particular it will act as a single point of contact for persons and
organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to
support OpenBSD in any way.
  
The OpenBSD Foundation will initially concentrate on facilitating
larger donations of equipment, funds, documentation and
resources. Small scale donations should continue to be submitted
through the existing mechanisms.
  
The OpenBSD Foundation corporate charter, bylaws, and goals can be found at
http://www.openbsdfoundation.org. The foundation directors may be contacted
via email at directors@openbsdfoundation.org.
