<LI id="route-aggregration">
<strong>Project:</strong>

FIB route aggregation for OpenBGPd.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

With the default-free zone reaching 500,000
prefixes it is desirable to aggregate these prefixes by next-hop. The
aggregates can then be inserted into the forwarding information base
(FIB, i.e. the kernel routing table). This project involves designing
and implementing an efficient algorithm (both in time and space) to
calculate aggregates while there are constant updates / withdraws
from BGP peers, some sort of rationale why that algorithm is correct,
a regression test for the algorithm and finally implementing it in OpenBGPd.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

Aggregated routes in the kernel routing table.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Strong understanding of C, Classless
Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

<LI id="network-configuration-daemon">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Design and implement network configuration daemon.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Gathering the disparate network configuration mechanisms into one
daemon that can provide coherence and a single point of control would
greatly enhance the usefulness of OpenBSD in complex networking
setups. The current mechanisms that are candidates for assimilation
include dhcp, dhcp6. rtsol, and ifconfig. Similar efforts are underway
on many os projects, which will serve as useful sources of ideas.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A single daemon subsuming at least two previous configuration mechanisms
with a clear design for further assimilation.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, kernal networking interfaces, dhcp.

<LI id="bfd">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Implement BFD support as described in RFC 5880 and RFC 5881.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Bidirectional Forwarding Detection is a protocol to
actively detect faults in the forwarding path between two routers.  In OpenBSD
BFD will extend the current link-state tracking to do end to end test
between two hosts.  This project involves writing a basic BFD
implementation which in a second step will be integrated into the network
stack. Finally interoperability with various other systems needs to be
tested.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working BFD implementation for OpenBSD. 

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Strong understanding of  C, Networking.

<LI id="nvgre">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Add support for the NVGRE protocol.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Support for virtual overlay networks with the VXLAN
protocol has been introduced in OpenBSD 5.5 with the vxlan(4) driver.
An alternative approach is the NVGRE protocol that that is currently
described in the IETF draft "draft-sridharan-virtualization-nvgre-07".
It is an extension to the GRE protocol and can be added to OpenBSD's
gre(4) driver.  It would need support for the GRE key, the NVGRE
headers, integration into bridge(4) and ifconfig(8) using the same
interfaces and semantics that have been created for vxlan(4).
Additional interoperability testing with Microsoft's Windows Server
2012 or newer would be required.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A patch for gre(4) to support the GRE key and NVGRE.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, kernel networking interfaces, Ethernet, IP, Windows Server configuration.

<LI id="usb-userland-xfer">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Asynchronous USB transfer submission from userland.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Extend the existing interface exposed by ugen(4) and
usb(4) and used mainly though
<A HREF="http://www.libusb.info">libusb</A>, or
 design a new one, to
be able to submit USB transfers asynchronously.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working interface supporting at least control, bulk and interrupt transfers.

<P><strong>Knowledge prequisite:</strong>

C, USB, device drivers.

<LI id="webrtc">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Proper WebRTC integration in Mozilla.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

The WebRTC API within Firefox is not yet fully
functional nor stable on OpenBSD. Sound integration not finished,
testing coverage very low.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

WebRTC working & enabled by default within Firefox in
OpenBSD's ports-tree. Patches properly integrated upstream.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, IPC.

<LI id="sdmmc">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Add sdmmc stack to sys/lib/libsa.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

One of most problematic missing part for having a working boot block on armv7 is
that there is no minimal sdmmc stack code in sys/lib/libsa.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working sdmmc stack in sys/lib/libsa.

<P><strong>Knowledge prequisite:</strong>

C, device drivers, ARM.

<LI id="ports-modules">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Infrastructure for integrating OpenBSD Ports and module
installation frameworks.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

OpenBSD Ports contain many small ports for Ruby
gems, CPAN modules and so on. Those ports are mostly simple "wrappers"
that rely on corresponding port modules. There are a few problems with
this design: 1) in OpenBSD Ports, it's needed to manually duplicate
version requirements from upstream package; 2) maintaining a full port
structure for each small upstream package consumes too much time from
maintainers.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

Fully-automated process of creating and updating
ports for upstream modules packages.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, perl.

<LI id="libressl-struct">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Unit Test, Measure and Replace LibreSSL data structures

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

LibreSSL has inherited a number of files to
implement basic data structures (e.g. hashing, lists) which are then
used internally to the library.  The implementation of many of these
data structures could benefit from review, and possible
reimplementation to a more safe and efficient standard.
<P>
This project would be to write unit tests and measurements to both
verify the correctness of the internal data structure implementations,
and measure them for benchmarking purposes. Once that is done an
effort can be made to selectively re-implement some of these data
structures - probably in coordination with LibreSSL developers.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

Unit tests and measurements for internal LibreSSL data structures.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Testing, measurement, a strong background in C
and data structures - ability for independent research and
measurement.

<LI id="wscons">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Implement a wscons version of libinput.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

The wscons version of libinput will open the road for enabling
multi-touch support in X and a future Wayland port.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working wscons version of libinput.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

X, C.

<strong>Project:</strong>

Xen guest support for OpenBSD

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

The Xen hypervisor exposes a virtual guest ABI for x86_32, x86_64
and ARMv7 architectures.  Several portions of this ABI are
architecture-independent, such as device drivers for the Xen device
drivers and XenStore. Support can be ported from NetBSD and FreeBSD,
which have had support for a few years now.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

Boot OpenBSD as an accelerated HVM guest or a native PV guest on Xen.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Strong understanding of C and/or operating systems.

<LI id="kms">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Implement a simple KMS driver to the kernel.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
The X server is moving away from the legacy
model where drivers had direct access to the hardware to set the
video modes and handle acceleration. This project is about creating
more KMS drivers beyond the existing intel and radeon ones. It can
target a relative simple driver like Cirrus (that's useful for
people running under Qemu). This would make it possible to use the
xf86-video-modesettings driver to run X with allowaperture=0 (ie
without privileges) on these systems.

<P><strong>Expected result:</strong>

An implementation of a kernel KMS driver for one simple
graphics card, providing the basic graphics mode settings operations
needed to run X with the xf86-video-modesettings driver.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisites:</strong>

C, device drivers. Notions about the X.Org driver architecture.

<LI id="usb-dump">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Implement a tool to dump USB device descriptors.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>
Extend usbdevs(8) or write a new tool to dump the device
descriptors of connected USB devices, something like "lsusb -v".

<P><strong>Expected result:</strong>

A working tool able to at least dump Device,
Configuration, Interface and Endpoint descriptors.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisites:</strong>

C, USB, ioctls.

<LI id=usb-xhci>
<strong>Project:</strong>

Implement xHCI isochronous transfer support.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

xhci(4) can currently submit control, bulk and interrupt
transfers.
Supporting isochronous transfers would make it possible to use
devices like uvideo(4) or uaudio(4) behind it.

<P><strong>Expected result:</strong>

A patch for xhci(4), and if necessary to the USB stack, to
support isochronous transfers.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisites:</strong>

C, USB, xHCI, device drivers.
