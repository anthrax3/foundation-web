<ul>
<LI id="llvm-sanitizer">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Port llvm/clang sanitizer to OpenBSD.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

A port of the llvm/clang { address, thread, memory } sanitizer would provide a
valuable debugging and profiling tool for the OpenBSD community.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

An OpenBSD port of the llvm/clang sanitizer for at least one architecture.

<P><strong>Knowledge prequisite:</strong> llvm/clang, C.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="route-aggregration">
<strong>Project:</strong>

FIB route aggregation for OpenBGPd.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

With the default-free zone reaching 500,000
prefixes it is desirable to aggregate these prefixes by next-hop. The
aggregates can then be inserted into the forwarding information base
(FIB, i.e. the kernel routing table). This project involves designing
and implementing an efficient algorithm (both in time and space) to
calculate aggregates while there are constant updates / withdraws
from BGP peers, some sort of rationale why that algorithm is correct,
a regression test for the algorithm and finally implementing it in OpenBGPd.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

Aggregated routes in the kernel routing table.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Strong understanding of C, Classless
Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="nouveau">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Port X.Org nouveau driver to OpenBSD.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Support for more X drivers is always needed to allow OpenBSD to work with
the widest possible range of hardware.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working nouveau driver for OpenBSD.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

X, C, KMS, TTM, graphics.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="evdev">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Create Linux evdev compatible input layer for wscons.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

evdev support will open the road for enabling multi-touch support in X and
a future Wayland port.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working evdev compatible input layer in wscons.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

X, C.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="wdc">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Reimplement wdc(4) using the atascsi subsystem.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Elimination of wildly unsupportable wdc(4) and related components would
provide substantial improvements to support for cfcard and intel ide devices.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working replacement for the wdc(4) and related components.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, device drivers.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="fdt">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Implement a flat device table (fdt) tool chain.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

The flat device table (fdt) mechanism is used in a various SOC implementations
and OpenBSD currently lacks a tool chain to create, manipulate and explore
the required structures.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working fdt tool chain.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, device drivers.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="arm-bootloader">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Implement a boot loader for ARM systems.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Implement a proper OpenBSD style boot loader for ARM systems.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working boot loader for at least one supported ARM platform, preferably
Beaglebone Black.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, device drivers, ARM.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="llvm-static-analyzer">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Implement LLVM/Clang-based static analysis checker.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

 LLVM/Clang exposes the whole AST to a developer
enabling to create tools based on it. Recently OpenBSD removed
lint(1) -- a legacy tool which uses static analysis to find potential
security bugs. This project involves creating a more useful
LLVM/Clang-based static analysis checker which finds constructs which
are deemed unsafe in OpenBSD. Such unsafe constructs are currently
documented in manual pages under CAVEATS sections.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

 LLVM/Clang-based static analysis checker catching
constructs which are deemed unsafe in OpenBSD.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Strong understanding of C and static analysis.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="arm-hw-floating-point">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Hardware floating point for OpenBSD/armv7.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Currently on OpenBSD/armv7 floating point
operations are emulated in libc using softfloat, although the hardware
does support hardware floating point. This project involves bringing
hardware floating point support in OpenBSD/armv7 userland.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

Hardware floating point support in OpenBSD/armv7 userland.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Understanding of the ARM architecture and floating point.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="usb-userland-xfer">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Asynchronous USB transfer submission from userland.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Extend the existing interface exposed by ugen(4) and
usb(4) and used mainly though
<A HREF="http://www.libusb.info">libusb</A>, or
 design a new one, to
be able to submit USB transfers asynchronously.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working interface supporting at least control, bulk and interrupt transfers.

<P><strong>Knowledge prequisite:</strong>

C, USB, device drivers.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="sdmmc">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Add sdmmc stack to sys/lib/libsa.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

One of most problematic missing part for having a working boot block on armv7 is
that there is no minimal sdmmc stack code in sys/lib/libsa.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working sdmmc stack in sys/lib/libsa.

<P><strong>Knowledge prequisite:</strong>

C, device drivers, ARM.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="webkit2">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Fix Webkit2 API on *BSD.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

The split-process rendering API in Webkit available
since 2.0 doesn't work on *BSD.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

Working API within Webkit, with patches in the
ports-tree, and the same code properly integrated upstream.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, IPC.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="webrtc">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Proper WebRTC integration in Mozilla.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

The WebRTC API within Firefox is not yet fully
functional nor stable on OpenBSD. Sound integration not finished,
testing coverage very low.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

WebRTC working & enabled by default within Firefox in
OpenBSD's ports-tree. Patches properly integrated upstream.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, IPC.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="pipex">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Replace existing three PPP implementations with enhanced pipex.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Three of the three existing PPP implementation (ppp, pppoe, sppp) should be
removed and any functionality from them that is currently missing from pipex
should be added to pipex.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A pipex implementation that does everything ppp, pppoe and sppp do.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, device drivers, PPP.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="ports-modules">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Infrastructure for integrating OpenBSD Ports and module
installation frameworks.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

OpenBSD Ports contain many small ports for Ruby
gems, CPAN modules and so on. Those ports are mostly simple "wrappers"
that rely on corresponding port modules. There are a few problems with
this design: 1) in OpenBSD Ports, it's needed to manually duplicate
version requirements from upstream package; 2) maintaining a full port
structure for each small upstream package consumes too much time from
maintainers.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

Fully-automated process of creating and updating
ports for upstream modules packages.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, perl.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>

<HR></LI>


<LI id="networkmanager">
<strong>Project:</strong>

OS-agnostic NetworkManager analog.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

NetworkManager is a de-facto standard on Linux
desktops. Unfortunately, it's highly Linux specific, and has some
design flaws, too. The idea is to create an easy-to-use GUI that tries
to implement as little network management logic itself as possible; any
missing features should be implemented as separate utilities/services
that integrate into the OS.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

Easy-to-use network management GUI working on OpenBSD
at least. It should be able to notify you about Wi-Fi networks, allow
you to choose and set up one, and set up and monitor VPNs.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, X, networking.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="accelerometer">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Act on accelerometer input in laptop.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Some laptops have integrated accelerometer sensors,
e.g., Lenovo ThinkPads has aps(4). The sensor data could be used to
put the laptop in less fragile state; e.g., the HDD heads could be parked.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

HDD heads should be parked automatically in 0,3sec
or less if laptop is being dropped.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

At least one laptop with an accelerometer (if
the latter is not support under OpenBSD, it will be needed to
implement a driver for it, too).

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="smtpd-milters">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Add milters support in smtpd.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

smtpd has a framework for writing session and content filters.
The idea is to write a filter that provides a bridge between
Sendmail's "Milter" API and smtpd's own framework. We've done
a bit of similar work by writing Perl and Python bindings, the
milter one would be similar but trickier.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

a "filter-milter" calls an unmodified milter and allows it to
run on top of smtpd, which will possibly require also extending
slightly our filters framework.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, IPC.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="seccomp-bpf">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Port Linux SECCOMP-bpf sandbox to OpenBSD.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Linux recently added an API for discretionary sandboxing using
small programs written in the bpf(4) bytecode format to inspect system
calls and their arguments. This project would port this API to
OpenBSD.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working port of SECCOMP-bpf that is API compatible with Linux. A
set of regression tests (written or ported). Successful sandboxing of
OpenSSH and Chromium using their existing SECCOMP-bpf code (adjusted for
differences between platforms).

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Familiarity with bpf(4), the Linux SECCOMP sandbox and/or the OpenBSD kernel.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="network-configuration-daemon">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Design and implement network configuration daemon.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Gathering the disparate network configuration mechanisms into one
daemon that can provide coherence and a single point of control would
greatly enhance the usefulness of OpenBSD in complex networking
setups. The current mechanisms that are candidates for assimilation
include dhcp, dhcp6. rtsol, and ifconfig. Similar efforts are underway
on many os projects, which will serve as useful sources of ideas.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A single daemon subsuming at least two previous configuration mechanisms
with a clear design for further assimilation.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, kernal networking interfaces, dhcp.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>
 

<LI id="java">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Java 8 on OpenBSD.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

The Java language remains an important part of
many enterprises' IT strategies.
OpenBSD has had Java in its ports tree since Java 1.3, but has stopped at 1.7.
The project is to adapt JDK 1.8's new build system into the OpenBSD
Ports way of doing things. If time remains after this is completed, it
can be used on updating other tools (IDEs) and applications to
levels which work for 1.8.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working JDK 1.8 properly integrated with the OpenBSD ports tree.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Strong understanding of C, Java. Access to a fast computer
running OpenBSD/amd64 and/or OpenBSD/i386.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>


<LI id="bfd">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Implement BFD support as described in RFC 5880 and RFC 5881.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Bidirectional Forwarding Detection is a protocol to
actively detect faults in the forwarding path between two routers.  In OpenBSD
BFD will extend the current link-state tracking to do end to end test
between two hosts.  This project involves writing a basic BFD
implementation which in a second step will be integrated into the network
stack. Finally interoperability with various other systems needs to be
tested.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A working BFD implementation for OpenBSD. 

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

Strong understanding of  C, Networking.

<P><strong>Mentor:</strong>
TBD
<HR></LI>

<LI id="nvgre">
<strong>Project:</strong>

Add support for the NVGRE protocol.

<P><strong>Brief explanation:</strong>

Support for virtual overlay networks with the VXLAN
protocol has been introduced in OpenBSD 5.5 with the vxlan(4) driver.
An alternative approach is the NVGRE protocol that that is currently
described in the IETF draft "draft-sridharan-virtualization-nvgre-07".
It is an extension to the GRE protocol and can be added to OpenBSD's
gre(4) driver.  It would need support for the GRE key, the NVGRE
headers, integration into bridge(4) and ifconfig(8) using the same
interfaces and semantics that have been created for vxlan(4).
Additional interoperability testing with Microsoft's Windows Server
2012 or newer would be required.

<P><strong>Expected results:</strong>

A patch for gre(4) to support the GRE key and NVGRE.

<P><strong>Knowledge prerequisite:</strong>

C, kernel networking interfaces, Ethernet, IP, Windows Server configuration.
